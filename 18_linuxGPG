# We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.
Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.
Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).

# GPG, or GnuPG, stands for GNU Privacy Guard. The GPG Project provides the tools and libraries to allows users to interface with a GUI or command line to integrate encryption with emails and operating systems like Linux.
GPG includes the tools you need to use public-key encryption and digital signatures on your Linux system.

# 1. Login on storage server & switch to root user

# ssh natasha@ststor01

# sudo su -

# 2.  All files located in /home 

# cd /home/

# ll

# 3.  Import gpg Private & Public key 

# gpg --import public_key.asc

# gpg --import private_key.asc

# 4. Kindly verify keys are imported successfully

# gpg --list-secret-keys

#  5. Will encrypt the file txt in to asc in same folder path 

#  6. Will decrypt the file asc in to txt  using passphrase within same folder path 

# gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt

# 7. check the encrpyted & decrypted files  in  /home

# ll

# 8.  Validate the task by cat the files output

# cat decrypt_me.asc

# cat encrypt_me.txt

# cat encrypted_me.asc
