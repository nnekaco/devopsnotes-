#Task
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.

As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.

#1. At first login to app server  & Switch to  root user 

ssh banner@stapp03

sudo su -

#2  Verify the existing  resolve.conf file
cat /etc/resolv.conf

#3 Edit the  resolv.conf  file and add public DNS 8.8.8.8 as per task.
vi /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
cat /etc/resolv.conf
